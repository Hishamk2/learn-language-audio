00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
And tomorrow is the same day.

00:02.000 --> 00:06.000
So then it is better to keep the fast in the morning according to the Nafil.

00:06.000 --> 00:12.000
If the news of the moon comes from somewhere, then the duty of Ramzan has been fulfilled by the same Nafil.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
Now do not keep his treasure.

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
And Badal, i.e. because of Abar, did not show the moon of Ramzan on the 29th.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
So do not eat anything for an hour from Dupahr.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
At that time when Badal was there, I did not know that it was the last moon.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
So from Dupahr to an hour before, do not eat anything, do not drink anything.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
If the news comes from somewhere.
