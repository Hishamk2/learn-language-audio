And tomorrow is the same day.
So then it is better to keep the fast
in the morning according to the Nafil.
If the news of the moon comes from somewhere,
then the duty of Ramzan has been fulfilled
by the same Nafil.
Now do not keep his treasure.
And Badal, i.e. because of Abar,
did not show the moon of Ramzan
on the 29th.
So do not eat anything for an hour
from Dupahr.
At that time when Badal was there,
I did not know that it was the last moon.
So from Dupahr to an hour before,
do not eat anything, do not drink anything.
If the news comes from somewhere.
