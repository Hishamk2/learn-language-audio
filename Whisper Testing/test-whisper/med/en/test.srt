1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And tomorrow is the same day.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So then it is better to keep the fast

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
in the morning according to the Nafil.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
If the news of the moon comes from somewhere,

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
then the duty of Ramzan has been fulfilled

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
by the same Nafil.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Now do not keep his treasure.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And Badal, i.e. because of Abar,

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
did not show the moon of Ramzan

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
on the 29th.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So do not eat anything

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
for an hour from Dupahr.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
At that time when Badal was there,

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I did not know that it was the last moon.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So from Dupahr to an hour before,

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
do not eat anything, do not drink anything.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
If the news comes from somewhere.
